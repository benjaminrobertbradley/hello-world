# hello-world

Hi, fellow IT folks!

I'm a super-newbie; yes, another one.  I have absolutely NO IDEA what I'm doing, or how well I'll even progress on this scary new venture of slowly transitioning into the IT industry.  It's vast, scary, and pretty overwhelming at times BUT, with some breathing exercises and faith-centered mantras, cold brew coffee and l-theanine, I believe I'll surprise even myself at what may come of this over the ensuing years.  I know there can be a lot of derisiveness towards newcomers in the IT industry; hell, that's true for any industry.  But I think the fear of resentment / ridicule / rejection is most hurtful.  After all, I like to think that most people are naturally inclined to help and support...  At least, that's how I attempt to approach others in this world.  So, I'm hopeful that I will do well with a fairly even reliance on both my desire to succeed and be a meaningful contributor as well as drawing from the support found within this incredibly facsinating industry.  Thanks, y'all. <3  

P.S. It's 'Lunar Tacos' and 'Terrestrial Tacos'
